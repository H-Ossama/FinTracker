## 🎯 **Why Hybrid Architecture?**

Traditional finance apps force users to choose between:
- **Cloud-only**: Requires internet, privacy concerns, vendor lock-in
- **Local-only**: No backup, no multi-device access, data loss risk

**FinTracker's hybrid approach gives users the best of both worlds:**
- ✅ **Privacy by default** (local storage)
- ✅ **Backup when wanted** (optional cloud sync)  
- ✅ **User control** (manual sync decisions)
- ✅ **No vendor lock-in** (export data anytime)
- ✅ **Works everywhere** (offline-first design)

*Built with privacy, user control, and real-world usage in mind.* 🚀
