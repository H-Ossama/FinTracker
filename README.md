## 🎯 Why Hybrid Architecture?

Traditional finance apps force you to choose between:
- **Cloud-only**: Requires internet, privacy concerns, vendor lock-in
- **Local-only**: No backup, no multi-device access, data loss risk

**FinTracker's hybrid approach gives you the best of both worlds:**
- ✅ **Privacy by default** (local storage first)
- ✅ **Backup when wanted** (optional cloud sync)  
- ✅ **User control** (you decide what to sync)
- ✅ **No vendor lock-in** (export your data anytime)
- ✅ **Works everywhere** (offline-first design)
