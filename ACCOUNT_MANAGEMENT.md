   â”œâ”€â”€ SQLite database (transactions, wallets, etc.)
   â”œâ”€â”€ AsyncStorage (settings, preferences)
   â”œâ”€â”€ SecureStore (auth tokens)
   â””â”€â”€ Sync data (cloud settings)
5. Signs out user automatically
6. App returns to clean login state
```

### New Account Creation:
```
1. User signs up/logs in
2. Check if demo data should be seeded
3. Initialize with clean state:
   â”œâ”€â”€ Default categories only
   â”œâ”€â”€ No transactions
   â”œâ”€â”€ No wallets
   â””â”€â”€ No mock data
4. User can add their real data
```
